# AngularAssignment

1. Create an Angular App from scratch and Use this Fake Api  (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) in your component to display List of Posts in a Table and also use pagination to display the data in a page wise manner. 


Note: If you face any cors issue then prefix this with your api. (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/). Dont forget to request for temporary access by visiting the url for the first time.


2. Create a form in Angular which will take employeeName, employeeAddress, employeePhoneNumber, employeeDob, and employeeEmail and show all the entered data on console. You can use any module like FormsModule or ReactiveFormsModule.


Note: For Styling purposes you can use your own css or you can use bootstrap or Angular Material as well.

Note: Make Sure you are handling null and undefined errors in your table. And your forms must have validation for Empty and null fields. (Validation includes Email Validation, Phone Number Validation i.e 10 digit).
